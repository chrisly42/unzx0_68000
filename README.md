A fast decompressor for the ZX0 format for 680x0 CPUs.

ZX0 by Einar Saukas, a successor to ZX7, reaches compression ratios in the ballpark of Exomizer, without requiring any decompression tables. 

Use [Salvador](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/salvador) or [ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) for compression here.

The ZX0 depacker for 680x0 is available under the zlib license. You can use it in any way that you like.
